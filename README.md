To improve or expand this task, I would:
- Discuss the API design and endpoint requirements with the team to ensure alignment.
- Pair program with a teammate to implement new features or debug issues.
- Use code reviews to share feedback and learn from others' suggestions.
- Document the code and decisions clearly to make it easier for others to contribute.

If I had more time, I would:
- Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the API is robust.
- Explore advanced TypeScript features like decorators to simplify code.
- Add CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
